      Register Inferno as a bulk data client with the following information, and
      enter the client id and client registration in the appropriate fields.
      This set of tests only checks the Group export. Enter the group export
      information in the appropriate box.

      Register Inferno with the following JWK Set Url:

      * `#{Inferno::Application[:base_url]}/custom/g10_certification/.well-known/jwks.json`

      This scenario verifies the ability of the system to export clinical data
      for multiple patients in a group using [FHIR Bulk Data Access
      IG](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/STU2/). This scenario uses [Backend
      Services
      Authorization](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/backend-services.html)
      to obtain an access token from the server. After authorization, a group
      level bulk data export request is initialized. Finally, this scenario
      reads exported NDJSON files from the server and validates the resources in
      each file. To run the test successfully, the selected group export is
      required to have resources conforming to every profile mapped to [USCDI
      data
      elements](https://www.healthit.gov/isa/us-core-data-interoperability-uscdi).
      Additionally, it is expected the server will provide Encounter, Location,
      Organization, and Practitioner resources as they are referenced as must
      support elements in required resources.

      Prior to executing this scenario, register Inferno with the following JWK Set Url:

      * `#{Inferno::Application[:base_url]}/custom/g10_certification/.well-known/jwks.json`

            Bulk Data servers are required to authorize clients using the [Backend Service
            Authorization](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/backend-services.html)
            specification as defined in the [FHIR Bulk Data Access IG
            v2.0.0](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/STU2/).

            In this set of tests, Inferno serves as a Bulk Data client that requests authorization
            from the Bulk Data authorization server.  It also performs a number of negative tests
            to validate that the authorization service does not improperly authorize invalid
            requests.

            This test returns an access token.
